```{r}
set.seed(03031988)
library(data.table)

# Comment this out when data does not need to be reloaded
# rm(train)

if (!exists('train')) { train <- data.table(read.csv('train.csv', na.strings="-1")) }
if (!exists('test')) { test <- data.table(read.csv('test.csv', na.strings="-1")) }

```

## Data transformation
Info from the Kaggle page:
* The **_bin** suffix means that it is a dummy variable. 
* The **_cat** suffix means that it is a categorical value.
* **-1** means that the value is missing. This has already been taken care of when loading the data.

```{r}
# Transform categorical values - train
cols <- grep("\\_cat",names(train),value=T)
train[, (cols) := lapply(.SD, as.factor), .SDcols=cols]
# train[cols] <- lapply(train[cols],as.factor)


# Transform boolean values - train (also target)
cols <- grep("\\_bin|target",names(train),value=T)
train[, (cols) := lapply(.SD, as.logical), .SDcols=cols]

# Transform categorical values - test
cols <- grep("\\_cat",names(train),value=T)
test[, (cols) := lapply(.SD, as.factor), .SDcols=cols]

# Transform boolean values - test
cols <- grep("\\_bin",names(train),value=T)
test[, (cols) := lapply(.SD, as.logical), .SDcols=cols]

rm(cols)

# Remove id
train <- subset(train,select=c(-id))
test <- subset(test,select=c(-id))
```

## Exploratory analysis

```{r}
names(train)
str(train)
dim(train)
```

How many complete rows are there?
```{r}
# Absolute
nrow(train[complete.cases(train),])
# Relative
nrow(train[complete.cases(train),]) / nrow(train)
```

## Sampling for computing speed
```{r}
# For computing speed purposes, code is written by testing it on a 10k non-missing data record data set.
# Uncomment the next line to work with a sample.
train <- train[sample(nrow(train[complete.cases(train),]),10000,replace=F),]
```

## Fitting all variables
```{r}
lmAll <- glm(target~.,data=train)
summary(lmAll)
```

## Subset selection

### Filter method
Here is a correlation matrix.
```{r}
cor(train)
```

### Wrapper method

We can use the bestglm or regsubsets package to find out the best variables for each n where n is the amount of predictors. This is slow as hell because it is a huge data set, even when sampled, as it has 2^57 models.

```{r}
library(regsubsets)
# lmReg <- regsubsets(target~.,data=train,nvmax=57,really.big=T)
```

What about forward and backward selection.
```{r}
# Backward
lmBwd <- regsubsets(target~.,data=train,method="backward")
```
